    What is ESCAPE

    Establish a single collaborative cluster of next generation European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI)
    facilities in the area of astronomy and accelerator based particle physics in order to implement a functional link
    between the concerned ESFRI projects and European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).

    What is ESFRI ?
    European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI)
    https://www.esfri.eu/forum

    * Establish a European roadmap for Research Infrastructures for the next 10-20 years, stimulate the implementation of these facilities, and update the roadmap as needed
    * Support a coherent and strategy-led approach to policy making on Research Infrastructures in Europe
    * Facilitate multilateral initiatives leading to a better use and development of Research Infrastructures, with the ESFRI acting as an incubator for new initiatives
    * Ensure the follow-up of implementation of already on-going ESFRI projects after a comprehensive assessment, as well as the prioritisation of the infrastructure projects listed in the ESFRI roadmap to implement the European Research Area (ERA) - Priority area 2
    https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/strategy/european-research-infrastructures/esfri_en

    What is EOSC

    The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) is an environment for hosting and processing research data to support EU science.

    What is OSSR ?


The ESCAPE Open-source Scientific Software and Service Repository (OSSR) is a sustainable open-access repository to share scientific software and services to the science community and enable open science.
    https://projectescape.eu/services/open-source-scientific-software-and-service-repository

    It will house astro-particle-physics-related scientific software and services for data processing and analysis, as well as test data sets, user-support documentation, tutorials, presentations and training activities.

    * To support a community-based approach for continuous development, deployment, exposure and preservation of domain-specific open-source scientific software/tools/services in the global context of the EOSC, catalogue of services
    * To enable open science interoperability, software re-use and development for the data analysis of the ESCAPE ESFRI projects.


    What is CEVO ?

    Work Package 4 of ESCAPE, “Connecting ESFRI projects to EOSC through VO framework” (CEVO)

    * Assess and implement the connection of the ESFRI and other astronomy Research Infrastructures to the EOSC through the Virtual Observatory framework.
    * Refine and further pursue implementation of FAIR principles for astronomy data via the use and development of common standards for interoperability including the extension of the VO to new communities.
    * Establish data stewardship practices for adding value to the scientific content of ESFRI data archives.
