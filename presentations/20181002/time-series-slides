Time series data model :

Recent meeting in Strasbourg made good progress on developing the IVOA time series.

Two proposed data models converged into a single model for simple time series.

Details of the model should be published later this month, in time for discussion at the next IVOA meeting in November.

Time series data discovery :

Three routes for data discovery
* Position based search results for sources may include links to associated time series
* Extend ObsCore search criteria to include time domain criteria, TimeCore 
* Combination position and time domain search criteria

Road map for extending the exisitng DAL protocols to support these discovery modes published by the DAL working group.
"TimeSeries Discovery and Access DAL procedure"
"Bonnarel and Molinaro"


Time series data serialization :

Three proposals for data serialization, all based on nD cube packaged in a VOTable

* utypes
* VODML
* VODML-Lite

The data TABLE section of the VOTable is identical in all three cases.
The discusssion relates to how to include data model references in the VOTable header to describe the time series
in such way that a client can interpret the data correctly.

We are developing examples using a set of test data sets, which include Gaia DR2 light-curves, to demonstrate the different serialization formats. 

Work will be published in an IVOA note (deadline end of October) in time for discussions at the next interop (mid November)

Time series data serialization :

If all three serialization formats work for all of the science use cases, what should we use as selection criteria ?

What are your priorities ?
