disclaimers in intro (from Marco)
---------------------------------
- I'm DAL biased
  + and science platforms are a wider topic
- I'm resource curation biased
  + though they form the basis to work upon: data driven science

possible disclaimers from both
------------------------------
- I am / we are not _the IVOA_
  + I/we have been asked to give a VO/interoperability view
  + I/we will try to put here questions, not solutions
- mention ESCAPE/EOSC attachment about interperability (WP4) and cloud (WP5)

[Talk ~outline w/ comments]

VO technologies within a science platform
-----------------------------------------
- what's good for: 
  + not reinvent the wheel
  + provide data/service resources in an interoperable way
  + basic metadata richness needed to enable science portal operations
  + long term sustainability of the effort to build a (single/project dedicated) Science Platform
- drawbacks: 
  + implementation efforts
  + contributing to a global open standard community

VO technologies to enable interoperations among science platforms
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- what's the goal
  + enable direct re-use of data/service/code/workflow resources among standalone SciPlats
  + continue working on the ecosystem idea sitting behind the IVOA vision
- where are the hurdles: 
  + interoperable _data_ resources
  + interoperable _code_ resources
  + moving them around in a realistic and reasonable way
- what's there and what should be there:
  + data discovery and access open VO standards (upgrade them as needed)
  + interoperable AAI solutions (talk to GWS, there's work to be done there)
  + network transfer metadata characterization to enable multi SciPlats interoperations
  + code/workflow/container/... discovery and data-plug meta-description (registry matters)
  + IVOA has metadata standards for describing data, we don't have anything for describing code
  + There probably already are some standards for this, so we should find/evaluate and adopt them rather than invent new ones

Addendum
--------
FAIR return of science platforms
  + they can be poweerful
  + but have to be designed to be so (see all of the above)

Quick assessment of FAIR in the IVOA, where are we now ?

Findable
- good for data
- poor for code
- we need new metadata to describe code and execution environments

Accessible
- good for data (publishing archive data)
- poor for code
- executable code will need more work on A&A
- poor for data (publishing user results)
- do we need public user space to make results accessible ?

Interoperable
- good for data
- good for code ?
- it works as long as we use standard data formats for software inputs
and outputs

Re-usable
- good for code
- best practice for code re-use is fairly well documented (GitHub etc.)
- poor for data
- do we need public user space to make results re-usable ?
