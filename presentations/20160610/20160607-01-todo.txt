    Current projects at the WFAU archives, with an emphasis on
    ADQL (IVOA Astronomical Data Query Language)
    
    An overview of our work at ROE on implementing an ADQL service on SQLServer,
    how we ensure that our local users are supported and how that feeds in to
    our work on the ADQL standard, including our work within the IVOA ensuring
    that ADQL is implementable on a range of different database platforms.

        Strasbourg

            VOEvent use cases
                Different use cases - Diamonds and Firehose

                LIGO/VIRGO - diamonds
                    Current VOEvent implementation is fine for LIGO/VIRGO use case ?
                    No changes needed

                LSST - firehose
                    LSST are planning an internal review of VOEvent for LSST
                    Current event content - undecided.
                    Current transport protocol is too chatty for scale of LSST stream
                    
                

            GW EM follow up use case
                SIAP with observation timestamp
                Create some experiments to demo what is already possible



        Heidelberg

    Cloud compute
        Slow progress
        IPv4
            Limited resources (36 new addresses for ROE, 4 for OpenStack)
            Edge security on private LAN means we have to be careful
            Using physical switch to create a separate LAN looks like the best option
        IPv6
            We might get a /64 subnet .. in 6mths time.
            Autoconfig will be disabled and DHCP6 probably won't be available/configurable.
            Using physical switch to create a separate LAN looks like the best option
            
    FireThorn
        Fixed limit bug (April)
        TODO - JUnit testing
        TODO - DQP testing
        TODO - DQP MAX() etc
        TODO - Quoted identifiers

    SQLServer translator for ADQL parser
        Working with Gregory @ heidelberg and Theresa @ stsci
        Getting closer to merging three versions into one
        Theresa and Gregory provided support for NATURAL joins

    Genius
        Autocomplete can now use TAP_SCHEMA as well as VOSI for the metadata,
        making it compatible with ESAC service.
        
        GoogleWebToolkit (GWT) wrapper for the auto complete code, ready for ESAC to import into their system

    Local TAP
        TAP service for Atlas is ready to be deployed on the cloud compute platform
        Network issuesÂ on shepseskaf means we are waiting for new cloud compute before we deploy public version
        Wrapped Astrogrid XML based registry in a virtual machine and tested registering our TAP service
        TAP service passes 100% of Mark Taylor's taplint validation tests

    Local VO services
        Plans to include ConeSearch and Registry
        Replacing all of the old AG services with new implementations
        Deployment will use Docker containers on cloud compute platform
         

    Docker paper
        Text and diagrams done, needs editing and pruning
        Conclusion needs work
        
    Pyrothorn
        Setup script uses Python install tools to import dependencies
        Spin-off into separate project, enabling re-use outside of FireThorn


    AstroTROP
        Final meeting done :-)
        Working services deployed on external cloud
        TODO write up details of the software stack
        TODO deploy on internal cloud compute
        Learned a lot about GIS standards and software
        Learned a lot about Docker along the way
