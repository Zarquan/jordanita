    The line was due to be deployed last week.
    OpenReach engineer arrived, looked at the location and asked who had done the survey.
    We replied "what survey" .. and OpenReach engineer started making "hmm, not good" noises.
    Since then, OpenReach people have dug a new trench from street cabinet to pole and installed a new (fiber?) cable in the ground.
    I think this is because we are the first in our area to request FTTP?

    Due to COVID we are not at the premises very often, and we booked the install for last week because we were here for ~10 days.
    It now looks like the installation will take longer than that.
    If it doesn't happen by Wednesday 17th we will have to cancel the FTTP order and schedule for another time, probably Jan/Feb 2022.
