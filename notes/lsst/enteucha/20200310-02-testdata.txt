    range is the spread either side of the target + and - 
    count is the number of points to fit into that range
    
    if count < range, spreading <count> points over <range>  with gap > 1
    if count > range, squeezes <count> points within <range> with gap < 1

    as count becomes larger and range becomes smaller, the gap between points is reduced
