    Paving the way to simultaneous multi-wavelength astronomy
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03520v3


    "Given the discovery of an apparent disc-jet coupling cycle occurring far faster than expected
    from viscous timescales in 3C 120 (Lohfink et al. 2013), simultaneous monitoring on the
    timescales of weeks-months of such systems across IR-optical-UV-X-rays holds the promise of
    revealing how jets from such AGN are launched."

    "... This is a powerful technique and requires simultaneity between bands
    on timescales of less than that of the time lag; as this is a light travel time, simultaneity on
    timescales of < hours is often required (extending to day timescales for the largest size scales).

    "... In this respect, having long term monitoring of a sample of blazars in radio,
    optical and γ-rays, with at least a week sampling and simultaneity on day timescales, could add
    important information about .... "

    "... It is worth noting that even in this well-coordinated campaign, there were substantial
    challenges: notably the lack of advanced warning of observations required scheduling of ToOs
    to ensure optimal (if not overlapping) coverage."

    "... In order to study TDE jet formation (and how this compares between the thermal and non-
    thermal subclasses) rapid multi-wavelength follow-up (within a few days) mainly in radio and
    X-rays is required to study the initial phase of the event and the onset of the jet. In order
    to study substructures in the lightcurve, simultaneity on sub-day timescales is expected to be
    required. Finally, it is important to stress the importance of long-term monitoring of TDEs
    in order to identify the point at which the jet switches off and how this connects with the
    properties of the accretion flow (see Donnarumma & Rossi 2015)."

    "... X-ray observations show roughly daily non-thermal flares with amplitudes from a few to
    hundreds of times the quiescent value."

    "... The required simultaneity is ∼hour, however, unlike
    other sources where there are populations available to study, Sgr A* is unique and presents
    unique challenges. Notably, various instruments located around the world have to wait for
    the Earth’s rotation to bring Sgr A ∗ into view which may take longer than a typical flare
    duration (e.g. the source is not visible by Keck and VLA in the same visibility window making
    simultaneity in those bands challenging to obtain)."

    (page 10 of 52)

    ....
    ....

    "By using (particularly wide-field) telescopes capable of automatically and rapidly respond-
    ing to transient alerts reported by high-energy, neutrino and gravitational wave facilities (e.g.
    Kashiyama et al., 2013; Abbott et al., 2016), it will become possible to capture the SN shock
    exploding through the progenitor star, which is known as a“SN shock break-out”. As such an
    event occurs within minutes to hours, they have only ever been detected serendipitously (e.g.
    Soderberg et al. 2008 - Figure 11; Schawinski et al. 2008; Gezari et al. 2010; Ofek et al. 2010).
    Rapid-response, multi-wavelength observations will allow us to detect this phenomenon whilst
    strictly simultaneous observations at the very early-time (within a few days) will allow us to
    explore the explosion physics, in turn shedding light on SN progenitors (e.g. Wang et al. 2007;
    Maeda et al. 2013)."

    (page 27 of 52)

    ....
    ....

    "In studying the prompt emission, the very short duration (seconds) makes it difficult to
    obtain multi-wavelength observations. However, the expanded bandpass of triggering instru-
    ments (e.g. Fermi LAT with Fermi GBM), the advent of fully robotic ground-based telescopes
    and the short Swift slew times has meant the wavelength coverage of bursts during this phase
    has increased."

    ....
    ....

    "... At early times (within a day
    following the GRB), simultaneity requirements are generally hours or less for optical/IR and
    X-rays, and up to a day or so for longer wavelengths. At later times following the GRB, these
    requirements are more relaxed as the characteristic timescales are slower.

    (page 31 of 52)

    other examples (X-ray binary discs/jets) mention response times > 0.1 sec

    "As indicated in the previous section, for some objects/processes, the relevant
    timescales can be as short as milliseconds, which clearly sets the bar at a completely different
    level."

    (page 33 of 52)

    "... While the former requires strict simultaneity, it can be scheduled days
    in advance, and can in principle last for just a few hours; conversely, GRB observations need to
    be activated and scheduled with very short notice, can last for several days (to several weeks
    for the afterglow at radio frequencies) and can often achieve only quasi-simultaneity (within a
    few hours)."

    (page 33 of 52)


    - response times

    "Response times to ToO triggers and DDT requests at certain observatories can take a
    long time to process depending upon available manpower, while some observatories do not
    consider time-critical observations to be a key driver and so are not prepared to handle
    such requests."

    - provisional status

    "As with obtaining non-simultaneous multi-wavelength observations, obtaining simultane-
    ous observations can often involve double-jeopardy with multiple observatories, with one
    observatory wishing to commit time only after another observatory has agreed to do so."

    "Simultaneous observations are not occurring as often as they could be, because telescope
    observing schedules are often not known (or cannot be known due to uncertain weather
    conditions). Whereas some observatories report their short-term, or real-time, observing
    schedules, most do not."

    Criteria for 'interesting' differ widely between the different areas of interest.

    Each would require different systems for monitoring and filtering to detect 'interesting' things.
    Given an 'interesting' thing ...

    Parameters for an 'observation window' :

        position in the sky
        wavelengths required
        time window required

    Who is available to do an observation within that window ?

    1) Select appropriate instruments
    2) Select active instuments
    3) Select based on field of view within timescale (geographical location, Earth's rotation and field of view)
    4) Select request method .. automated or manual requests ?

    IVOA data helps with

    1) Instrument description, metadata and semantics.
    2) Is there a registry of instruments ?
    3) Footprint - MOCs etc.

    looking forward using published observation plan
    or looking back using database of observation history

    Do we need to do all of the clever stuff beforehand, or just poll the databases ?

    December 2018

        Talking about a 'prototype', but pulling in different directions.


        Marjan Timmer :

            Too hard in time available :

                Rapid response handling
                Galaxy information
                Other tools, e.g. those developed in ASTERICS and the VO
                Alert handling

            ESAC protocols that we could link to

                Visibility and planning information

        Mark Kettenis :

            The dashboard idea is probably the part of the proposal that I picked up most.

            (still not clear if we are talking about a website or a desktop app)

        - (Dave) Dashboard layers:

            IVOA standard should be incorporated.
            IVOA standard _could_ be incorporated.

            LSST is engaged in the standards proposed from ESAC

            (Dave participated in the ESAC meeting and is taking care on LSST involvement in this activity).
            (Dave _has seen a presentation about_ the ESAC meeting and is _observing_ the LSST involvement in this activity.

            The "low" level of maturity for this standard is considered a weakness, although it shouldn't be a drawback but an advantage to incorporate it in the platform, even if the maturity is low.
            Um - I don't think I said that.

    Actions

        - Back-end I/O --> Dave: work on the IVOA standard to define the parameters to be included in the DB.
