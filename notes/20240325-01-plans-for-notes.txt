    Target:

        Plans for how we manage our notes going forwards.
        It is probably not appropriate to keep our notes in SKA SRCNet projects.
        Time to move to a single repository for all our notes.

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------

    Celastrina to become our global notes repository.

        Do we want to change to CC ?
