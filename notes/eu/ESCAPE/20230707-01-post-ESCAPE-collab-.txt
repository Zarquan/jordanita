    Target:

        Success

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

# -----------------------------------------------------
Introductory session.

    Lots of 'open'
    Lots of 'ivoa', but no specific funding for IVOA.

    Reading between the lines, ESCAPE is/was open and interoperable because IVOA was open and interoperable.
    No new standards for data sharing or discovery.

    We guarantee the ability / rewards for scientists adopting this framework.
    Ability to move between platforms and combine the data.
    ... but ESCAPE is designed as silos.

# -----------------------------------------------------
OSSR

    'Our repository' .. but OSSR doesn't have a repository.
    They curated a set of entries in Zenodo.

    Skipping over the search termns that enable software discovery.

    EOSSR - a long term stable archive .. on other people's hardware, software and schemas.
    Totally dependent on CERN continuing to run Zenodo.
    Already 52 entries !! (including 5 of our own).

    Software quality - but they dropped all the barriers to get ESAP into the repository.

Show me
Does the eOSSR library have full test coverage ?

    Q Baptiste - you mentioned data sets ?
    A Kay - yes, not for big data (science data - we have IVOA and DataLake for that)
    more for test data published alongside the software.

    Q roland - high cost, developers required to do lots to make it acceptable to ossr
    what is the benefit ?

    A Kay -linking your software and papers
    potential 100's or 1000's of citations :-)?

Show me
What level of coverage do OSSR entries get ?
Prove it, what metrics do you measure.

CEVO/IVOA

DataLake

    You mentioned multiple projects using a common infrastructure.
    Each project managing their own data lake.
    Is there support for data interchange between the projects
    e.g. CTA using SKA data ?

    Is it possible to find out where data is located ?
    Where the data is *now*, and where it _could_ be ..

        Setup time  0 if already here
                    estimate in seconds to transfer the data
        Access speed [fast|medium|slow]

        Machine learning model to estimate execution time.
        Given a query and a dataset, estimate the execution time.
            Prototype this on gaia-dmp

    Nested set of 'groups' that client can match without needing to know the details.
    Hirerarchy defined by 'parent' reference.

    DataLake in a box - interesting

VirtualResearchEnvironment VRE

    Reana + Rucio + Dask ...
    CERN based system

    Examples of science projects al;ready using VRE.
    Very impressive, but a closed system.

    How does Reana defne the hardware requirements ?
    e.g. gpu type and count ?

    Simplified architecture :
        Single instance JupyterNotebook platform
        Single instance of compute platform
        Single instance of Rucio that has access on all the compute locations.

    Scientist doesn't have to worry about compute location,
    because they only have one.

    How can we make this interoperable with other platforms ?

# -----------------------------------------------------
EOSC

    Expertise in Exabyte datasets
    .. but the demo relies on uploading the data to a central storage platform.
