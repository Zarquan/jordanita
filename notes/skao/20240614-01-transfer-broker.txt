    Target:

        TransferBroker service ?

    Result:

        Work in progress ...

    Data Management API
    https://data-management.srcdev.skao.int/api/v1/www/docs/oper

    The API is procediral.
    Get this, put this, it doesn't have any predictive operations
    e.g cost estimation for a transfer without actually doing it.

    We could build a simple estimation service that moves
    test files, measures the time, and builds a database
    of cost estimates for node to node transfers.

    We can define the API and create a mock service
    using a simple database of guesses.

    Using the same data model as execution broker ?

    TransferBroker
        Request to transfer data <A> to platform <B>
        => offers
        Use the TransferBroker offers to build the ExecutionBroker offers.

    TransferBroker at EDI, checks if the data is already at EDI.
        if islocal
            increase the expiry date to match the offer lifetime
            offer the data with zero transfer time
        else
            call upstream TransferBroker at RAL
            calculate transfer time from RAL to EDI
            add local transfer time to the RAL offers
            offer the data with non-zero transfer time

    TransferBroker at RAL, checks if the data is already at RAL.
        if islocal
            increase the expiry date to match the offer lifetime
            offer the data with zero transfer time
        else
            do stuff with SKAO data managment API to find replicas
            calculate transfer time for each replicas
            add replicas transfer time to the offers
            offer the data with non-zero transfer time

    Feature unassigned - Extend Science gateway functionality to request data staging via the SRCNet Data Management API
    https://jira.skatelescope.org/browse/SP-3731

    Unasked question - *why* would the user want to move the data ?
