From the CADC website (https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/caom2/):
The Common Archive Observation Model (CAOM) is a general purpose data model for use
as the core data model of an astronomical data centre.
The purpose of this model is to standardize the core parts of every archive implementation
so that a common set of software tools can be used across archives.
This set of tools includes simple data access mechanisms (web pages), discovery agents,
advanced query capabilities (typically as IVOA web services), and advanced applications.

This work explores how we can represent the eMerlin data in the CAOM data model.

The work is split into two parts:
1) The first part of the work involves comparing the
CAOM data model with the eMerlin data, and creating a
mapping between them.
Identifying points where they don't match
and developing solutions to solve the problems.
2) The second part of the work involves using the
CAOM toolkit to ingest a subset of the eMerlin data
into a CAOM database, and demonstrate how the data
can be accessed using the CAOM data access services.
