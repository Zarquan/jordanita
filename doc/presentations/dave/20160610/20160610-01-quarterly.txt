    OSA

        Bug fixing and maintenance

        BUG - Duplicate columns in results
        
        Initial fix in place (reject with error)
        
        Interesting discussion, here and in the IVOA

        What should the best practice response be ?

        Suggested best practice

            a) If there is *no* alias rename to random
            b) If there *is* an alias accept duplicates
                
    Firethorn - TAP

        Fixed MAXREC limit bug
        Passes 100% of Mark Taylor's taplint validation tests

        Waiting to be deployed on cloud compute platform

        Wrapped legacy AstroGrid XML based registry in a virtual machine
            Tessted TAP service registration


    Firethorn - ADQL

        ADQL query service for OSA

        Working with Grégory Mantelet (CDS / Heidelberg) and Theresa Dower (Space Telescope) on merging support for SQLServer.

            Theresa and Gregory are providing support for NATURAL joins
        
            Theresa is providing functions to implement TAP registry.

Gives us support for the latest registry standard.
Allows us to retire the AstroGrid XML based registry.

            Space Telescope are working on implementing geometry in SQLServer.

                * We will adopt and adapt their code when it is ready 

            Working with Gilles Landais (CDS) on support for Vizier quoted identifiers.

                SELECT
                    RAJ2000,
                    DEJ2000
                FROM
                    "J/ApJ/716/1217/table2" AS table2
                WHERE
                    ....

    Firethorn - distributed queries

        Not worked on for many months
        Basic tests are failing - effect of changes to other components 
                
        Building new set of tests to identify broken parts
        Need to allocate time for getting this working again


    Firethorn - Local VO services
        
        Looking at implementing (re using) ConeSearch in new platform
        
        Replacing all of the old AG services with new implementations
        Deployment using Docker containers on cloud compute platform
         

    Pyrothorn - TAP/ADQL testing

        Test infrastructure for TAP/ADQL services

        * Setup script uses Python install tools to import dependencies
        * Spin-off into separate project, enabling re-use outside of FireThorn


    Genius - Autocomplete

        * Autocomplete can now use TAP_SCHEMA for the metadata
        * Compatible with ESAC service.
        
        * GoogleWebToolkit (GWT) wrapper for the Autocomplete component done
        * Compatible with ESAC service.
        
    Genius - Crossmatch

        * Requires Firethorn distributed query.
      

    IVOA - ADQL

            Added BOOLEAN data type
            Added hexadecimal literals

            Deprecated coordinate system from the geometric functions

                CIRCLE(‘’, ra, dec, radius)

                CIRCLE(ra, dec, radius)

            Added POINT based geometric functions

                CIRCLE(pos, radius)

            Best practice advice for cross match

                DISTANCE(...) < x

            Agreement to close version 2.1 and move to Proposed Recomendation

    IVOA - JSON

        Significant interest from several groups, not least LSST.
        Working on IVOA note to combine input from ROE, LSST, CADC + others


    IVOA - CapeTown

            Good contact with delegates from LSST 

            Brian Van Klaveren (SLAC/LSST) on TAP, ADQL and QServ

            Working on LSST implementation of TAP in front of QServ.
            http://wiki.ivoa.net/internal/IVOA/InterOpMay2016-DAL/LSST_DAX_IVOA_Interop_May-2016.pdf

            Overall very positive about using VO standards where applicable.
            https://community.lsst.org/t/ivoa-interop-meeting-notes-may-2016/829

            John Swinbank on TimeDomain and VOEvent

            Working on VOEvent standard
            http://wiki.ivoa.net/internal/IVOA/InterOpMay2016-TDIG/2016-05_-_VTP_at_InterOp.pdf

            LSST are planning an internal review of VOEvent
            Transport Protocol is too verbose for LSST stream
            VOEvent content is undecided

    
    Asterics - LIGO/VIRGO Gravity Wave projects

        Strasbourg 31 May-1 June 2016
        https://www.asterics2020.eu/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=open:wp4:wp4gwstrasbourg2016

            VOEvent - different distinct use cases - Diamonds and Firehose

            LSST - firehose

            10 million events per night
            6hrs = ~ 500/sec
            2ms per event

            LIGO/VIRGO - diamonds

            Current specification is working for LIGO/VIRGO

            Key use case for the VO is Electro Magnetic (EM) follow up

            Generic follow up query :
            Everything within [date-range] for [field-of-view] patch of sky.

            Observation date is key for reconstructing the history.

            Based on field of view of each telescope
            Experiment to see if SIAP does what they need

            Do we (WFAU) want our data to be used for EM follow up ?
            If so, we probably need to implement ObsCore and SIAP.


    Asterics - Data providers workshop
    
        This week in Heidelberg


    Cloud compute

        Basic KVM support - in progress

            * Updating the KVM tools from shepseskaf to provide basic VMs on one of the trop machines.
            * Initial set of Docker host VMs for AstroTROP

        OpenStack
        
            * Still learning

        Networking
        
            * IPv4

                Limited resources (36 new addresses for ROE, 4 available for OpenStack)
                Edge security on private LAN means we have to be careful
                Using physical switch to create a separate LAN looks like the best option

            * IPv6

                We might get a /64 subnet, but we don't know when.
                Autoconfig will be disabled and DHCP6 probably won't be available/configurable.
                Using physical switch to create a separate LAN looks like the best option

            IPv6 is important for us to be ready

                Google is seeing IPv6 use growing steadily
                http://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html

                Apple require IPv6 support for apps submitted to the App Store
