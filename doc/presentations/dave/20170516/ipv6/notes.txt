What is IPv6 ?

Internet Protocol version 6.

Internet Protocol (IP) is the primary protocol for routing datagrams (packets) across network boundaries.

----------

Internet connections involve multiple different players.

university departments, service providers, telecoms compaines, local and national exchanges, international cables and connections

    computer  network   compter
          network   network
               network

For most of us, for most of the time, we represent all this complexity as like this

    coumputer <--> cloud <--> coumputer

----------

The routing packets between computers is based on numerical addresses.

The header of each packet contains the address of the sender and receipient.

For our purposes, these act like sending SMS text messages between phones using telephone numbers.

We are all familiar with the 192.168.1.2 format of these numbers.


Which is the main part of the problem.

We have run out of numbers.

----------

Designed in 1981, Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) uses 32bit numbers to route traffic.

Familiar four numbers separated by dots represent the four bytes of a 32 bit number.

    192.168.1.2

    [192] [168] [1] [2]

----------

32bit number gives us a theoretical space of 4294967296 (2^32) addresses.

Not all of the 4.3 billion addresses can be used for end users.

Some blocks are allocated for special functions and private networks.

Rapid growth in the 1990's used up the available addresses faster than anticipated.

As of now, all of the available blocks have been allocated.

----------


WFAU only has four public IP addresses for all our VO services

Which is why we need HTTP proxy servers for public endpoints.

----------

Sucessor protocol (IP version 6) was invented in 1998.

IPv6 uses 128-bit numbers, giving a theoretical space of 3.4Ã—10^38 address.

The intention is not to use all of this huge space.

Expectation is use will be sparse, with whole blocks allocated to end user equipmanet with only a few addresses used in each block.

----------

Example, a department may be allocated a full /64 or /48 address.

That means 48 of the 128 bits are used to identify the department, leaving 80 bits for routing within the premises.

Internally the local network might use 8 bits to identify individual buildings, 8 bits to identify floors in a tower block, 8 bits to identify rooms on a floor, 8bits to identify racks in a room, 8bots to identify machines in a rack ..

8 bits for buildings
    8 bits for floors in a tower
        8 bits for rooms on a floor
            8 bits for racks in a room
                8 bits for machines in a rack

                    16 bits for virtual machines in a physical machine

                        16 bits for container in a virtual machine


           = 72 bits

Splitting up the addresses like this makes sense because it makes routing much easier.

----------

even if you only have two buildings, two floors, four rooms, two racks with four machinces in each

    my home,
        house and garage,
            upstairs and downstairs
                office, two bedrooms and bathroom
                    two machines in office
                    one rack with
                        four machines in garage

    Sounds crazy .... but

    ESP8266 $5 wifi enabled micro controller that runs Python
    https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/1/1/2/9/13678-01.jpg

to do this ... every light bulb needs to have a unique address

----------


So what is not to like ?

    Huge address space

    Simplified routing based on blocks

    Whole blocks of addresses per person

What have we been doing for the last 19 years ?


----------


If none of the other institutes have IPv6,

when I upgrade my network to IPv6,

no one will use it.

As log as some institutes only have IPv4,

I still need to publish everything via IPv4.


----------

Until .. one day

----------

Most of the major institutes have IPv6,

new services are published on IPv6

limited access to legacy services via IPv4,


----------

Big infrastructure projects
