VOEvent diamonds and firehose

The fire hose

    LSST's own slides refer to drinking from the firehsoe.

    With a continous stream of this scale, replaying the last n minuites
    is probably not an option.

Acknowledging every individual event is probably not an option.

Event sources will need to be 'robust' with slow or unresponsive clients.

The diamonds

    Every LIGO event is a precious diamond.

    [image]

    Each one has the potential for a major discovery.

A replay facility. would be extremly useful.

Missing that one event because your broker was offline for a few
minuites is not an option.

To guarantee delivery, every event needs acknowledging

Event sources will need to be 'tolerant' of slow or unresponsive clients.

Is this one protocol ?

    Can a single protocol meet what seem to be
    two sets of opposite requirements.  

    LSST and LIGO represent the extremes.

    What about the cases in between.

LSST filter

What about a broker that takes the LSST stream and
filters out 80% of the events.

The resulting stream has 20% of the events from LSST.
Is this a fast or a slow stream.    

LSST events themselves are likely to be unevenly distributed
across the sky. With busy and quiet periods for the even stream.

    [image]

If the events this filter is interested in occur during 
a busy period, then the filtered stream is likely to
amplify the non-uniformity rather than smooth it.

LIGO follow up

What about a broker that recieves a LIGO event and
generates a burst of 10,000 of events for follow up
observations for the eaxch LIGO event.

The result is a bursty stream, with long periods of
silence followed by short periods of very intense
activity.

Adding elasticity

elasticity

<i>noun</i>    

1. the ability of an object or material to resume its normal shape after being stretched or compressed;

synonyms: stretchiness, flexibility, pliancy, suppleness, rubberiness, plasticity, resilience, springiness;

Sending blocks of events 

Allow events to be sent and acknowledged
in blocks.

During busy periods, the block size grows, reducing
the overhead of acknowledging every event.

    ----[#][*]----[#][*]----[#][*]----[#][*]----

    ---[##][*]----[##][*]--[##][*]--[###][*]----

    --[######][*]-[######[*]###][*]-[######][*]--

Resticting the replay facility

Restict the replay facility during busy periods.

Allowing the server to responed to replay requests
with a 'busy' response during busy periods.

If the event rate rises, the server may only offer
a limited replay facility, only replaying a small
number of very recent events.

If the event rate drops, the server may provide a
more extensive replay facility providing access to
a larger number of historical events.

        Volunteers needed to promote this one.
        

    SuperNova data
    
    Keppler light curves

    IVOA needs to be more flexible and accessible.
    What is the offer ... spend extra time and resources to get an official stamp ?

    VOEvent Protocol RFC comments


Applications
 
    "Each author, each subscriber and each broker uses a unique IVOID for its identification.
    Thus all of them must be fully registered in the VO registry."

Agree, we should look at changing this to anyURI.


    Consequences of a broker going temporary off-line... 
    .... most of the subscribers will just miss the backlog messages.
    
Yes, this is an issue.
The importance will depend on the value of a single event.
- next version ?

    .... limited in term of number of subscribers per
    brokers due to the TCP connection keep alive constraint
 
Yes, this is an issue, and we should address this in the next version of the document
- next version ?
